I’m a data analyst who doesn’t just work with numbers; I bring order to chaos. When data is messy, incomplete, or confusing, that’s when I shine. 

I dive in, clean it up, and turn it into clear, actionable insights that help businesses make smarter decisions. 

No jargon, no overcomplication, just straightforward solutions with impact.

## What I’m Great At
### 🐍 Python
- Cleaning and analyzing data with pandas and NumPy
- Automating tasks and repetitive workflows
- Writing clean scripts that get the job done without overcomplicating things

### 🧮 SQL
- Writing complex queries (joins, aggregations, subqueries, window functions)
- Working with MySQL, SQLServer
- Always on the lookout for better query performance and clearer logic

### 📊 Power BI
- Designing dashboards that tell stories, not just display numbers
- Using DAX for calculated measures and columns
- Data shaping and cleaning in Power Query
- Making reports that are interactive, clear, and useful

### 🔢 Advanced Excel / Google Sheet
- Mastery of formulas like XLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, and QUERY
- Building smart dashboards and automation with PivotTables and VBA
- Cleaning up raw spreadsheets and making them business-ready

### 🚀 Real Things I’ve Done

- Built automated Excel templates for finance tracking using formulas and  VBA macros
- Analyzed real estate market data in Brazil using SQL + Python
- Created clear, insight-focused dashboards in Power BI for business and personal projects
- Helped small businesses clean up their financial records in Sheets and understand their expenses data better
